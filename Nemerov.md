#+TITLE Howard Nemerov and Objective Idealism

# Chapter 1
## “The Mind’s Eye Lit the Sun”
### *Imagination as the Agent of Reality

“The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not a fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central life all animal and vegitable life is merely parasitic.”

As Thoreau approached the end of his stay at Walden Pond, he spoke with certainty of a “living earth” whose very shape mirrored the human form. Seldom in modern poetry has the sense of a “living earth” been more fully illuminated than in the poetry of Howard Nemerov. And while Nemerov certainly believed that this passage in *Walden* comprised Thoreau’s most enlightening there, it is essential to see the particular way in which the notion of a “living earth” develops and unfolds in Nemerov’s own poetry.

To do so, one must turn not only to Thoreau but also to a rather diverse group of writers, artists, scientists, and philosophers, all of whom, nonetheless, share this insight into the world: chief among them are Coleridge, Hopkins, Proust, Brueghel, Magritte, Escher, Lewis Thomas, Herman Weyl, Kenneth Burke, and Owen Barfield. Of all these, Barfield presents the most complete synthesis of the ideas to which Nemerov was continually drawn. Barfield’s theory of perception is shaped around the notion of a “living earth”; indeed, a willingness to accept Thoreau’s observation is perhaps the first stage in understanding both Barfield’s philosophy and Nemerov’s poetic expression of it.

In his *Saving the Appearances* and *Worlds Apart*, Barfield’s central contention is that humans are not just passive observers of reality but active participants in it. “Nature,” which has in recent times referred only to the world “outside” us, is for Barfield the living expression of human nature.
