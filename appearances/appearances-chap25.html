<h1 id="xxv-the-mystery-of-the-kingdom">XXV<br/>THE MYSTERY OF THE KINGDOM</h1>
<p>It was pointed out in Chapter XXIII that the attainment by humanity of a new moral standpoint may mean doing violence to moral judgements. Some violence is inevitable when men are called on, in any sphere, not to <em>correct</em> their previous ideas by removing some error, but actually to move forward to a new plane that includes, rather than replaces, the old. In the moral sphere, what was until now simply ‘good’, is seen for the first time no longer as an absolute, but also as the enemy of a better—and yet it has still also to be grasped as good. This ‘tragedy of progress’, as I called it, is the source of most of the ‘hard sayings’ in the Gospels. Consider for instance the parables of the labourers in the vineyard, and of the prodigal son. Our deep-rooted feeling for the goodness of justice and equity has to be outraged, because we are being beckoned towards a position directionally opposite to the usual one; because we are invited to see the earth, for a moment at all events, rather as it must look from the sun; to experience the world of man as the object of a huge, positive outpouring of love, in the flood of whose radiance such trifles as merit and recompense are mere irrelevancies.</p>
<p>Now there are no harder sayings to be found in The Gospels than the group which deal with the use and purpose of parabolic utterance. Take for instance the verses which follow immediately after the parable of the sower in the 13th Chapter of St. Matthew (vv, 9-13):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that he hath.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore speak I to them in parables; because they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing there a moment, it must be admitted that if we try to accept all this just as it stands,¹ and without any context or key to its meaning, then, to say that it ‘does violence’ to moral judgements is an understatement. The surface-meaning is not just severe, it is brutal. Nor is there any substantial difference in that respect between the passage quoted and the parallel passages in St. Mark iv, 9-12 and St. Luke viii, 9-10. If we want to understand what was really in the mind of the Speaker, we have to go deeper. And first of all, we notice how it all leads up to a phrase which contains a marked echo of certain passages in the Old Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such echoes are frequent in the reported sayings of Jesus and attention is often drawn to them in the margins of annotated Bibles. Clearly his whole diction was saturated with recollections of this nature, even when no precise allusion can be fixed. The New Testament is, in a sense, latent in the language of the Old. In this case, however, in St. Matthew’s version of the discourse, the allusion to the Old Testament <em>is</em> both precise and explicit. For Our Lord continues immediately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To trace the reverberation to its source, it is not enough simply to turn to the 6th Chapter of <em>Isaiah</em>. Eyes that see not, and ears that hear not—where have we met with them before? In those verses from the 115th Psalm which I have already quoted twice, in Chapters X and XVI. This Psalm was very familiar to Jewish ears. It is one of the six <em>Hallel</em> psalms, obligatory at many feasts, and according to the <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> would have been part of the ‘hymn’ that was sung by the Thirteen after the Last Supper. Moreover, they are repeated almost verbatim in the 135th Psalm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.<br/>They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<br/>They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turn again to the book of <em>Isaiah</em> and read the 44th Chapter, which is concerned mostly with idolatry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit . . . he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They have not known nor understood; for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see; and their hearts that they cannot understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be clear that, in order to understand the enigmatic words which, in the Synoptic Gospels, are interposed between the parable of the Sower and its interpretation, we must hear sounding through them as an overtone both the voice of the prophet Isaiah and the familiar voice of the Psalmist inveighing against graven images. We cannot do otherwise than read them as alluding to idolatry.</p>
<p>But to what kind of idolatry? It is quite impossible to assume that the <em>primary</em> idolatry—that is, the worship of images as <em>numinous</em>—of which the Children of Israel had once been guilty, was in the mind of Jesus. For how is it possible to fit any such allusion into the context? Moreover that kind of idolatry was no longer a besetting sin; it was one that had practically ceased to exist among the Jewish people. Thus, Conder in his <em>Outlines of the Life of Christ</em>, emphasizing the moral degeneracy which prevailed among the Jews at the time of the Nativity, could write (my italics): ‘<em>Idolatry excepted</em>, the darkest pictures painted by the Old Testament prophets of ancient Israel were realized.’</p>
<p>Something has already been said in Chapter XVI of two different kinds of idolatry. It was not only the first and obvious kind of which the Old Testament prophets were aware. There are some twenty different Hebrew words which have been rendered ‘idol’ or ‘image’ in the Authorized Version, and in addition to the presence of a false or filthy spirituality, it is clear that the Hebrew writers associated with images the almost opposite notion of <em>emptiness</em> or <em>nothingness</em>—the absence of any spirituality whatsoever. It is also clear from the passages already quoted that it was this secondary view of idols which was conceived as likely to be transferred to the subjective state of the idolator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They that make them are like unto them; and so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This subjective emptiness—which was perhaps also the ‘wilderness’ or ‘lonely place’ in which the Baptist is described as calling for ‘repentance’—seems to be the psychic condition which is brought about when the elimination of participation has deprived the outer ‘kingdom’—the outer world of images, whether artificial or natural—of all spiritual substance, while the new kingdom within has not yet begun to be realized. It is, as it were, the null point between original and final participation.</p>
<p>The particular parable which Jesus related in this way to idolatry was the parable of the Sower, but we are given to understand that what he said applied to all parables, and indeed that the ability to ‘know’ this parable was a sort of pre-condition for the understanding, or knowing, of any other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know ye not this parable? And how then will ye know all parables?²</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is it then about this particular parable—of the Sower—which called for this particular comment? Let us listen, first of all, to the ringing cry with which the parable concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has ears to hear, let him hear!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not peculiar to this passage. It is even a phrase which was used by other Rabbis as well as Jesus. But if we take the trouble to examine all the occasions on which he used the words, we shall find them always in association with the teaching of ‘the Kingdom’ within, of the light, be it of candle or of sun, that shines now from within, of movement from within outward, as opposed to movement from without inward. And so here; the disciples are first told, ‘Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,’ or, according to St. Mark,³ ‘Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but for them that are without all things happen⁴ in parables.’</p>
<p>The parable, then, was about the sowing of the word, the Logos, in earthly soil. It was an attempt to awaken his hearers to the realization that this seed was within their own hearts and minds, and no longer in nature or anywhere without. We have seen something of the change in the nature of all imagery and representation, which takes place with the transition from original to final participation. But ‘transition’ is a misleading word for the violent change in the whole <em>direction</em> of human consciousness which, in the last resort, this must involve. Henceforth the life of the image is to be drawn from within. The life of the image is to be none other than the life of imagination. And it is of the very nature of imagination that it cannot be <em>inculcated</em>. There must be first of all the voluntary stirring from within. It must be, not indeed self-created, but certainly self-willed, or else—it is not imagination at all; and is therefore incapable of iconoclasm. Iconoclasm is made possible by the seed of the Word stirring within us, as imagination. From him that hath not this seed—of final participation—there shall be taken away, even that residue—of original participation—that he hath.</p>
<p>Truly to grasp, or (if I may use the expression) ‘twig’ what is meant by the word and its sowing, involves some elementary grasp of, or feeling for, the nature of final participation, and therefore also of the nature of parabolic utterance. It is only possible to those in whom the word, however feebly, has already taken root. Conversely: to have no inkling whatever of what happens in the moment of parabolic utterance is to be incapable of grasping, or ‘knowing’, <em>any</em> parable, any metaphor, any symbol, any sacrament.</p>
<p>Therefore it is impossible that the main object which it is sought to achieve by parable should be helped by explanations. Only those in whom the seed has already sprouted, in whom the stirring has taken place, can benefit by any explanation. For them indeed it may help to turn the little they have into abundance. But for those who have as yet made no voluntary inward motion in the direction of iconoclasm, for those who have not suffered that change of direction of the whole current of a man’s being—the <em>metanoia</em>, or turning about of the mind, for which the heart’s name is ‘repentance’—explanations are of no avail. They will merely substitute one sort of idol for another. The interpretation itself will still need interpreting, and that interpretation also they will inevitably misconstrue in terms of their idolatry. This is in fact what has happened to the tremendous rubric: ‘The sower soweth the word.’ And one can well imagine the reluctance with which Christ launched it on the ocean of idolatrous misunderstanding, where we still mostly find it to-day.</p>
<p>The sowing of the word is commonly assumed to be no more than a pictorial way of referring to preaching and missionary activity. But how can this possibly be so? If this simple parallel is <em>all</em> that was intended, why are we warned so solemnly that the power to grasp it pre-supposes access to ‘the mystery of the kingdom’? Certainly the writer of St. Matthew’s Gospel himself leaves us in no doubt of his convictions, namely, that both the springing to life in man of ‘the Word of the Kingdom’ and its embodiment in parable were something to which Jewish history had always been leading up. For later, in the same chapter, at the close of a series of parables and similes intended to suggest the Kingdom, he adds (alluding to the long, historical 78th Psalm):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.⁵</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If on the other hand what is pointed to as the sowing of the word, is the coming of God himself into nature and man; if what is hidden in this and the other parables and metaphors concerning ‘the kingdom’ is the turning-point of time itself, is the change-over to that directionally creator relation which has already been referred to, then we should expect what we in fact find. We should expect these sayings to be the ‘hardest’ of all, and we should expect them to be connected with man’s overcoming of idolatry through the help of an invented or man-made imagery; for that is the first, wavering step on the road that leads to final participation.</p>
<p>Nobody can truly ‘receive’ such sayings who is without some inkling of all that the word and the Incarnation of the Word stand for in human evolution. This I have tried to describe in this book in the fuller and more precise perspective in which it can be seen to-day; but an understanding of the essence of it, in a different, older perspective—that is, in Greek and Hebrew versions of a ‘Logos’ teaching—had already become possible, as we have seen, before Christ came to the earth. To this understanding he appealed in the hard sayings.</p>
<p>Truly to imagine their effect on those of his followers who <em>had</em> the understanding, we must have ears to hear; to hear the Christ as the Representative of Humanity actually speaking to the handful in Palestine long ago. We shall recall, for instance, the great series of ‘I am—’ sayings in St. John’s Gospel: ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. . . .’ ‘I am the light of the world. . . .’ ‘I and the Father are one . . .’ and we shall reflect how near was the Aramaic dialect he spoke to Hebrew—so that at each ‘I am’ the disciples must almost have heard the Divine Name itself, man’s Creator, speaking through the throat of man; till they can hardly have known whether he spoke to them or in them, whether it was his voice which they heard or their own.</p>
<p>Now the Jews, as we have seen, were not interested in phenomena. They were interested in morality. And in their civilization it was the world of morality, not the world of nature, which thinking of the alpha type had been engaged in converting from a fountain of life into a system of laws. Our own idolatry, our mental and sensuous pharisaism, had hardly yet arisen; it was the idolatry of moral pharisaism which had first to be broken. We need not be surprised that the other idolatry, always latent, is only becoming fully apparent in our own day. Final participation is indeed the mystery of the kingdom—of the kingdom that is to come on earth, as it is in heaven—and we are still only on the verge of its outer threshold. Two thousand years is a trifle of time compared with the ages which preceded the Incarnation. More than a thousand had to pass before the Western Church reached even that premonitory inkling of final participation which it expressed by adding the <em>Filioque</em> to the Creed, and acknowledging that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son as well as, originally, from the Father.</p>
<p>The elimination of original participation involves a contraction of human consciousness from periphery to centre (cf. Chapter XI)—a contraction from the cosmos of wisdom to something like a purely brain activity—but by the same token it involves an <em>awakening</em>. For we awake, out of universal—into self—consciousness. Now a process of awakening can be retrospectively surveyed by the sleeper only after his awakening is complete; for only then is he free enough of his dreams to look back on and interpret them. Thus, the possibility to look back over the history of the world and achieve a full, waking picture of his own gradual emergence from original participation, really only arose for man with the culmination of idolatry in the nineteenth century. He has not yet learned to make use of it.</p>
<p>As we do so, the story of that gradual emergence will lie outspread before us in a clearer and clearer light. And as the mystery of the kingdom more and more unfolds itself, the Church, nursing mother of the still barely nascent Christ-impulse in men, must inevitably be faced with grievous decisions. Nothing is easier than to criticize the Church out of a sort of smug enlightenment. But in truth the difficulty has been wellnigh insuperable of maintaining the indispensable firmness of continuity with past tradition, while at the same time the meanings of all her armoury of words were being quietly melted away from within by an idolatry which had grown up without reference to her. In the dry husks that remain problems and dilemmas have swollen and multiplied, which, as we have seen, simply did not exist for the old participating consciousness that gave birth to the liturgy and the creeds.</p>
<p>For instance, a non-participating consciousness cannot avoid distinguishing abruptly between the concept of ‘man’, or ‘mankind’, or ‘men in general’ on the one hand and that of ‘<em>a</em> man’—an individual human spirit—on the other. This difficulty did not arise to anything like the same extent as long as original participation survived. Therefore our predecessors were able, quite inwardly, to accept the sin of Adam as being <em>their</em> original sin also. And therefore we are not—because, for us, Adam (if he existed) was after all—somebody else! This has brought with it the loss of the whole concept of the ‘fallen’ as an essential element in the make-up of human beings; which in its turn is responsible for the devastating shallowness of so much contemporary ethics and contemporary psychology.</p>
<p>With the doctrine of evolution the concept of ‘man’, as a thinkable entity, with a history behind him and a destiny in front of him, made a first confused reappearance. But, owing to the form which that doctrine took under the influence of the prevailing idolatry, this ‘man’ of evolution has no inner unity with the spirit of any particular individual man alive on earth at any particular moment. When the evolution of phenomena is substituted for our supposed evolution of idols,⁶ it will, I believe, be seen without much difficulty that the evolution of the individual human spirit has always proceeded step by step with the evolution of nature; and that both are indeed ‘fallen’. The biological evolution of the human race is, in fact, only one half of the story; the other has still to be told.</p>
<p>The awakened clarity of retrospect, to which I have recently referred, will, I am persuaded, be obliged to recognize that the gradual emergence of man from original participation amounts also to the gradual emergence of ‘men’ from ‘man’; that it is not just the cumulative history of the race, but the biography, also, of each individual spirit. Nor do I see how this can fail to involve the recognition of individual prenatal existence—or rather existences. Some understanding of this seems to have been common to most men before the West emerged from the East, and began the systematic ousting of original participation, about three thousand years ago. A renewal of that lost insight will almost certainly be one of the first steps to be taken by religion through the rebirth in her of that cosmic wisdom, which is the source not only of the world of appearances, but also of man’s changing relation to them.</p>
<p>I suspect that, for the Church, it will not be easy. It will not be easy for the nursing mother to accept the possibility that her charge has grown to need additional nourishment; or that revelation of the mystery of the kingdom was not turned off at the tap when the New Testament canon was closed, but is the work of an earth-time. Such a step will not be taken with ease; but in the end, if the Christ infuses my whole man, mind as well as heart, the cosmos of wisdom, with all its forgotten truths, will dwell in me whether I like it or not; for Christ <em>is</em> the cosmic wisdom on its way from original to final participation.</p>
<p>This book is a study in idolatry, and especially that last and greatest step in idolatry which we call the scientific revolution. In it I have drawn attention to the great benefits which this revolution has brought about. I could have said much more of this. Races which throughout the history of the world have never had enough to eat are being fed, while I write, by the great technocracy of America. I have alluded also to the priceless gifts of accuracy and precision. Yet, when the last balance comes to be struck between good and evil, I do not believe it will be those things for which men will remember the scientific revolution with thankfulness.</p>
<p>Man, said J. P. Sartre, is a being who is <em>condemned to freedom</em>. That is one way of looking at it. And it is the only way, if man himself is nothing but a hollow idol. But if man is not hollow, but is the theatre on which participation has died to rise again, then there is also another way of looking at it. If, in Christ, we participate finally the Spirit we once participated originally; if, in so doing, we participate one another—so that ‘men’ once more become also ‘man’; if, in original participation, we were dreamers and unfree, and if Christ is a being who can be participated only in vigilance and freedom, then what will chiefly be remembered about the scientific revolution will be the way in which is scoured the appearances clean of the last traces of spirit, freeing us <em>from</em> original, and <em>for</em> final, participation. And if what is produced thereby was, as I have suggested, a world of idols, yet, as Augustine of old could contemplate the greatest of evils and exclaim <em>Felix peccatum!</em> so we, looking steadily on that world, and accepting the burden of existential responsibility which final participation lays on us, may yet be moved to add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Felix eidolon!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Peor and Baalim Forsake their temples dim …’ the other name for original participation, in all its long-hidden, in all its diluted forms, in science, in art and in religion, is, after all—paganism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>¹ I take the Gospels as they stand, treating them (whenever they may have been written) as valid records left by wise and deeply responsible men. A good many of the arguments which have been advanced in favour of dissecting them will, I believe, disappear with the idolatry (as I have here ventured to call it) which now obstructs our penetration of their deeper meaning. Meanwhile, those who may still prefer to follow Jülicher, C. H. Dodd, Jeremias and others, in writing off Matthew 13, 9-13 and the parallels in Mark and Luke as later interpretations added by the primitive church, may also care to ponder whether the primitive church is likely to have understood rather more, or rather less, than the twentieth-century commentator of the actual content of this and other parables.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>⁴ <em>γιγνεται</em>. A.V. and R.V. have: ‘Unto them that are without all things <em>are done</em> in parables.’ It could also, conceivably, have been translated ‘all things are made in parables’, on the analogy of the clause in the Nicene Creed referred to on p. 170 (’by whom all things were made.’), where the same Greek verb is employed.</p>
