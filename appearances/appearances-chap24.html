<h1 id="xxiv-the-incarnation-of-the-word">XXIV<br/>THE INCARNATION OF THE WORD</h1>
<p>When we look back on past periods of history, we are often confronted with inconsistencies and blind spots in human thinking, which to us are so palpable that we are almost astonished out of belief. We find it hard to credit the inescapable fact that they remained, for decades or for centuries, completely invisible not only to the generality of men but also to the choicest and wisest spirits of the age. Such are the Athenian emphasis on liberty—with the system of slavery accepted as a matter of course; the notion that the truth could be ascertained and justice done with the help of trial by battle; the Calvinist doctrine of pre-election to eternal damnation; the co-existence of a Christian ethic with an economic doctrine of ruthless <em>laissez-faire</em>; and no doubt there are other and better examples.</p>
<p>I believe that the blind-spot which posterity will find most startling in the last hundred years or so of Western civilization, is, that it had, on the one hand, a religion which differed from all others in its acceptance of time, and of a particular point in time, as a cardinal element in its faith; that it had, on the other hand, a picture in its mind of the history of the earth and man as an evolutionary process; and that it neither saw nor supposed any connection whatever between the two.</p>
<p>I have offered my own explanation of this curiosity by pointing, as I did in Chapter IX, to the heavy weight of idolatry which rested on the Western mind at the time when the theory of evolution first appeared. To this must be added the marked reluctance of Christians to admit any sort of relation between their own religion and any religion which preceded it, except the Jewish, and latterly not much even with that. St. Augustine, it is true, affirmed that there had always been one true religion and that after the Incarnation this was called Christianity.¹ But the general tendency has been all the other way; and the study of comparative religions, which is still hardly a hundred years old, met at first, if any attempt was made to apply it to Christianity, with the same implacable hostility, though it now shows some signs of relenting. The loss of any participating experience of time may, I have suggested elsewhere, have something to do with this. To idolatry an event is <em>either</em> historical <em>or</em> symbolical. It cannot be both. There was accordingly a great, and in the circumstances a not wholly unjustified, fear. If it were once admitted that, for example, the Corn-god or the mystery religions had any significance for Christianity, or led up to it in any way, Christianity would itself promptly be assumed to be ‘derived from’ these religions and would dissolve away into anthropology and symbolism.</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation, the fact is very strange. When the horizon of time expanded suddenly in the nineteenth century, one would have expected those who accepted evolution and remained Christian, to see the incarnation of their Saviour as the culminating point of the history of the earth—a turning-point of time to which all at first led down and from which all thereafter was to lead upward. Moreover, having regard to the antiquity now attributed to the earth and man, one would have expected them to feel that we are still very very near to that turning-point, indeed hardly past it; that we hardly know as yet what the Incarnation means; for what is two thousand years in comparison with the ages which preceded it?</p>
<p>This is not in fact what is thought and felt by the relatively small number of people who still believe in the Incarnation. I have found that, when they are pressed to ‘make sense’, as it were, of the ages which preceded the birth of Christ—in which men also lived and died—the practice is to achieve it by postulating a retrospective effect of the Incarnation. This is indeed to abandon an idol-notion and to accept a participating or imaginal notion of time. But surely it also involves a sudden and uneasy jump in thought from time to eternity!² Such a leap cuts itself off, by refraining, from an understanding of the phenomenal world and is thus more appropriate to oriental and pre-Christian religion than to the time-embracing religion of the West.</p>
<p>Look here upon this picture and on this! The stumbling-blocks will only disappear when we substitute for the false picture, in our minds, of an evolution of idols, that other true picture of the evolution of phenomena. We have seen how original participation, which began as the unconscious identity of man with his Creator, shrank, as his self-consciousness increased, and how this was associated with the origin and development of language. We have seen how, in the last few centuries B.C. it had contracted to a faint awareness of creative activity alike in nature and in man, to which was given the name of the logos or Word. And then, we have seen (in Chapter XIX) the first faint premonitory symptoms of final participation appearing already in the first centuries of our era.</p>
<p>Between these two phases—if we meditated deeply enough on the nature and development of meaning in language—we could, if necessary, infer without other help, that the turning-point of time must have occurred. We could infer that the incarnation of the Word must have culminated.</p>
<p>What in fact happened according to the record? In the heart of that nation, whose whole impulse it had been to eliminate original participation, a man was born who simultaneously identified himself with, and carefully distinguished himself from, the Creator of the world—whom he called the Father. On the one hand: ‘I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me,’ etc. On the other: ‘I and the Father are one,’ etc. In one man the inwardness of the Divine Name had been fully realized; the final participation, whereby man’s Creator speaks from within man himself, had been accomplished. The Word had been made flesh.</p>
<p>In other men—though we have pointed to certain (mainly trivial) premonitory symptoms—that conscious realization has still barely begun to show itself. Except that the tender shoot of final participation has from the first been acknowledged and protected by the Church in the institution of the Eucharist. For all who partake of the Eucharist first acknowledge that the man who was born in Bethlehem was ‘of one substance with the Father’, and that ‘all things were made’ by him; and then they take that substance into themselves, together with its representations named bread and wine. This is after all the heart of the matter. There was no difficulty in understanding it, as long as enough of the old participating consciousness survived. It was only as this faded, it was only as a ‘substance’ behind the appearances gradually ceased to be an experience and dimmed to a hypothesis or a credo, that the difficulties and doctrinal disputes concerning trans-substantiation began to grow.</p>
<p>But, by the physical act of communion as such, men can only take the Divine substance, the ‘Name apart’ directly into the unconscious part of themselves; by way of their blood. And in this, as we saw in Chapter XII, we participate in two ways—both outwardly as a mere appearance (and, at present, therefore an idol) and inwardly by original participation. Thus, the relation between original and final participation in the Eucharistic act is, as we should expect, in the utmost degree complex and mysterious. If we accept at all the claims made by Christ Jesus concerning his own mission, we must accept that he came to make possible in the course of time the transition of all men from original to final participation; and we shall regard the institution of the Eucharist as a preparation—a preparation (we shall not forget) which has so far only been operant for the sidereally paltry period of nineteen hundred years or so.</p>
<p>To speculate, in a theological or cosmological context, on what might have been if things had gone otherwise, is from one point of view absurd. It is certainly foolish, if not blasphemous, to do so for the sake of doing so. But as a <em>means</em> to a better understanding of what has been and is, such speculation may be illuminating. The whole depth and poignancy of Augustine’s <em>felix peccatum Adae!</em>³ would be lost on anyone who was not prepared to suppose, even for an instant, that Adam might not have fallen.</p>
<p>With this end in view, then, we may permit ourselves to ask what would have happened if the incarnation of the Word had been understood at the time when it occurred; if Christ had been acknowledged instead of being crucified. In fact, by the time the Event happened, the pharisaical element in Jewish religion had apparently triumphed, balking the nation of the opportunity of fulfilling its destiny. Instead of realizing the inwardness of the Divine Name—a consummation to which their whole history had been leading—the Children of Israel had turned aside. The Name had ceased to be uttered even by the priests in the temple, and the Creator had been removed to an infinite external distance, as a Being, omnipotent indeed, and infinitely superior, but, in the way He was thought of, existentially parallel with man himself.</p>
<p>Yet—so we may speculate—this <em>need</em> not have happened. On the contrary, precisely the pharisees should hardly have needed even reminding of their nation’s destiny by the Saviour’s pregnant words; they should have leaped instantly into recognition of man’s Creator speaking with the voice and through the throat of a man. Logically there was the possibility of a gentle, untragic transition from original to final participation, the one maturing in proportion as the other faded. Within the limits of this sort of speculation we can even say that it was this which was ‘intended’. For the whole tenor of the Old Testament suggests that the imaginal consciousness characteristic of original participation was being destroyed, precisely in order that it might be reborn, ‘The rejection of idolatry’, writes Dr. Austin Farrer,⁴</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meant not the destruction but the liberation of the images. Nowhere are the images in more vigour than in the Old Testament, where they speak of God, but are not he … there is no historical study more significant than the study of their transformation. Such a transformation finds expression in the birth of Christianity; it is a visible rebirth of images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That rebirth, however, did not take place. The crucifixion did.</p>
<p>Original participation fires the heart from a source outside itself; the images enliven the heart. But in final participation—since the death and resurrection—the heart is fired from within by the Christ; and it is for the heart to enliven the images.</p>
<p>Once again, later—once perhaps, towards the close of the Graeco-Roman, Aristotelian age—we can speculate on a similar possibility which was never realized. Once more, we are made to feel, ‘there was a chance’ that the requisite transition should be accomplished with relative smoothness and without the loss being first experienced to the full. For by that time there had appeared many Christened minds, which were capable of holding together, as it were in tension, the non-representational religious consciousness characteristic of the Jews and the representational consciousness derived from Greece and Rome. Dionysius the Areopagite taught that God was at once ‘anonymous’ and ‘polyonomous’—nameless and many-named. And his treatise on the <em>Divine Names</em>, to which I have already referred, took deep hold of medieval thought. Aquinas’s philosophy, and in particular perhaps the two kinds of participation which we find referred to in it (see Chapter XIII), seemed on the threshold of effecting the transition gently. For, while his participation by composition (subject and predicate, form and matter) is specifically Aristotelian and looks backward to original participation, his hierarchical participation <em>per similitudinem</em>, derived in part from Dionysius, looks rather forward to the ‘final’ variety. And already, before Aquinas’s time, the startlingly sudden rise and spread throughout Europe of a rich crop of legends of the Holy Grail suggests an attempted uprush of the Eucharistic mystery from a substantially unconscious to a substantially conscious—and extra-sacerdotal—status.</p>
<p>To do more than mention such things here would be to go too far. It is enough that the possibility, if such it was, was not realized. Instead, before final participation could be said to have well begun, the collective representations, ‘the images’, were swept clean of the last vestige of original participation by that intellectual pharisaism, begotten (but again not <em>necessarily</em> so) of the scientific revolution.</p>
<p>It is time to return from the abstractions of what might have been to the concrete reality of what has been and is.</p>
